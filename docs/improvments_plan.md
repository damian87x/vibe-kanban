Of course. After a thorough review of the Vibe Kanban technical documentation and an analysis of your requirements for creating a "lovable clone," here is a verbose breakdown of what is missing and what needs to be implemented.

### **Executive Summary of Missing Features**

The existing **Vibe Kanban** architecture provides a robust foundation for orchestrating AI coding agents with its `git worktree` isolation and real-time log streaming. However, to evolve into a "lovable clone" focused on iterative development, frontend previews, and a comprehensive QA process, it fundamentally lacks **dynamic workflow management**, **true environment isolation (beyond the filesystem)**, and **integrated tooling for testing and API documentation**.

The current system is geared towards a linear execution of a single AI task within an isolated file tree. The proposed enhancements require a shift towards managing a multi-stage, customizable lifecycle for each task, complete with its own isolated and accessible development environment.

### \#\# 1. Dynamic and Editable Kanban Steps

**What's Missing:**

The current implementation has a hardcoded, static set of task statuses: `'todo'`, `'inprogress'`, `'inreview'`, `'done'`, and `'cancelled'`. This is a significant limitation and does not allow for the custom workflows you've described, such as a "Refinement" or "QA" stage.

**Proposed Solution:**

  * **Database Schema Changes:**

      * Introduce a new table, `project_workflow_steps`, to replace the hardcoded `status` enum.
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE project_workflow_steps (
            id         BLOB PRIMARY KEY,
            project_id BLOB NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id),
            name       TEXT NOT NULL,
            step_order INTEGER NOT NULL, -- To maintain column order
            description TEXT,
            created_at TEXT NOT NULL
        );
        ```
      * Modify the `tasks` table. The `status` column should be replaced with a foreign key to the new table: `workflow_step_id BLOB REFERENCES project_workflow_steps(id)`.

  * **Backend API Enhancements:**

      * Create new REST endpoints to manage these workflow steps for a project:
          * `GET /api/projects/:id/workflow-steps` - List all steps for a project.
          * `POST /api/projects/:id/workflow-steps` - Create a new step.
          * `PUT /api/workflow-steps/:id` - Update a step's name, description, or order.
          * `DELETE /api/workflow-steps/:id` - Delete a step.

  * **Frontend UI Implementation:**

      * In the project management view, add a "Manage Workflow" feature.
      * This interface should allow users to visually add, rename, reorder (drag-and-drop), and delete columns for their Kanban board, similar to the functionality found in Jira or GitHub Projects.

### \#\# 2. Multi-Step Execution and Custom Prompts

**What's Missing:**

The current model associates a single task with a single AI execution. There is no concept of a task progressing through multiple, distinct stages, each with its own specific command or custom AI prompt. For example, a "Refinement" step that runs `claude-code --generate-spec` followed by a "Development" step that runs `claude-code --implement-feature`.

**Proposed Solution:**

  * **Link Execution Logic to Workflow Steps:**

      * Extend the new `project_workflow_steps` table with columns to hold a command and a prompt template.
        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE project_workflow_steps ADD COLUMN agent_profile_id BLOB; -- Foreign key to a profile
        ALTER TABLE project_workflow_steps ADD COLUMN agent_command TEXT;    -- e.g., 'claude-code'
        ALTER TABLE project_workflow_steps ADD COLUMN custom_prompt TEXT;    -- A template for this step
        ```

  * **Frontend Task Creation:**

      * When creating a new task, the UI should present the defined workflow.
      * Users should be able to either accept the default prompt for each step or override it with a custom prompt specific to that task. This could be stored in a new `task_step_prompts` table that links a task, a workflow step, and a custom prompt.

  * **Backend Orchestration Logic:**

      * When a user moves a task from one column (e.g., "Refinement") to the next (e.g., "Development"), the backend should:
        1.  Identify the new workflow step.
        2.  Read the associated command and prompt.
        3.  Trigger a new **Execution Process** within the existing **Task Attempt**, using the specific prompt for that stage. This allows for a continuous, auditable log of activity within a single isolated worktree.

### \#\# 3. Isolated Environments and Frontend Previews (The "Lovable" Experience)

**What's Missing:**

Vibe Kanban's use of `git worktree` provides excellent **filesystem isolation** but not **environment isolation**. If two tasks run a `dev_script` that starts a web server on `localhost:3000`, they will conflict. The "lovable" experience hinges on providing isolated, network-accessible preview environments for every task.

**Proposed Solution:**

  * **Introduce a Reverse Proxy:**

      * Implement a lightweight reverse proxy as part of the Vibe Kanban backend. When a task's `Execution Process` starts a server, it should register its process ID and the port it's listening on with a central service.
      * The reverse proxy would then route requests based on a unique subdomain or path. For example, a request to `http://task-attempt-abc.vibe.local` would be proxied to the correct internal port (`localhost:XXXX`) associated with that task attempt.

  * **Port and Process Management:**

      * The `Executor Layer` needs to be enhanced. Instead of just running a `dev_script`, it should manage port allocation dynamically to prevent conflicts.
      * The `utils/` crate's `Port file management` could be extended for this, allowing a child process to write its allocated port to a known location for the parent to read.

  * **Frontend Integration:**

      * The `TaskDetailsPanel.tsx` component should display a prominent "Open Preview" button.
      * This button's URL would be dynamically constructed (e.g., `http://task-attempt-xyz.vibe.local`) and would point to the reverse proxy, giving the user instant access to the running frontend application for that specific task.

-----

### \#\# 4. Integrated Testing and QA Workflow

**What's Missing:**

The existing system has a testing strategy for the Vibe Kanban application itself, but not for the code *generated by the AI within a task*. A robust QA step requires first-class support for running tests and interpreting their results.

**Proposed Solution:**

  * **First-Class Test Execution:**

      * Define new `run_reason` types in the `execution_processes` table specifically for tests (e.g., `'unit_test'`, `'e2e_test'`).
      * In the project configuration, allow users to specify commands for running different test suites (`unit_test_script`, `e2e_test_script`).

  * **Test Result Parsing and Display:**

      * The backend's `Executor Layer` should be able to parse standard test output formats (like JUnit XML).
      * The results (number of tests passed, failed, skipped) should be stored in a new database table, `execution_process_test_results`.
      * The frontend should have a dedicated "Tests" tab within the task details view to clearly display these results, including logs for failed tests.

  * **Workflow Integration:**

      * Your desired QA workflow can be fully realized by combining this with dynamic Kanban steps. You can create a "QA" column where moving a task to it automatically triggers the `e2e_test_script`. The task cannot be moved to "Done" until all tests in the "QA" stage are passing.

### \#\# 5. API Discoverability with Swagger/OpenAPI

**What's Missing:**

The documentation lists the API endpoints, but there is no machine-readable specification or interactive documentation portal. This is a crucial feature for developer experience and for any potential third-party integrations.

**Proposed Solution:**

  * **Integrate an OpenAPI Library:**

      * Add a crate like `utoipa` or `okapi` to the Rust backend.
      * Annotate the Axum API handlers and the Serde data models (`crates/db/`) with macros provided by the library. These macros will be used to generate the OpenAPI schema directly from your source code.

  * **Serve Interactive Documentation:**

      * Add a new route to the Axum server, for example, `/api/docs`.
      * Use a crate like `utoipa-swagger-ui` to serve an interactive Swagger UI at this endpoint. This will provide developers with a web interface to explore every endpoint, view schemas, and even make test API calls directly from their browser.
