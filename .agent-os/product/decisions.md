# Key Decisions Log

> Product: TaskPilot AI Workspace
> Last Updated: 2025-07-26

## Overview

This document captures key technical and product decisions that have shaped TaskPilot AI's architecture and direction.

## 2025-07-26: Production Readiness Requirements Identified

**ID:** DEC-004  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Category:** Infrastructure  

### Decision
Identified critical production readiness gaps that must be addressed before public launch, including hardcoded URLs, missing HTTPS, and overly permissive CORS.

### Context
Production deployment revealed that OAuth flows were broken due to hardcoded localhost URLs, and security analysis showed multiple vulnerabilities.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clear roadmap for production readiness
- Security vulnerabilities identified before public exposure
- Proper foundation for scalable deployment

**Negative:**
- Delayed launch timeline
- Additional development effort required
- Temporary workarounds needed for demos

## 2025-01: OAuth Provider Abstraction

**ID:** DEC-003  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Category:** Architecture  

### Decision
Implemented a provider factory pattern to abstract OAuth providers, supporting both Klavis and Composio without code changes.

### Context
Klavis has a 3-user limit which is insufficient for production, while Composio offers 10k users. Need to switch providers without modifying business logic.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Easy provider switching via environment variable
- No code changes required for provider migration
- Clean separation of concerns

**Negative:**
- Additional abstraction layer complexity
- Need to maintain compatibility with multiple providers

## 2024-12: React Native with Expo

**ID:** DEC-002  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Category:** Technology  

### Decision
Chose React Native with Expo for the mobile application to enable cross-platform development with web support.

### Context
Need to support iOS, Android, and web from a single codebase with rapid development capabilities.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Single codebase for all platforms
- Rapid development with Expo tooling
- Easy OTA updates
- Web support out of the box

**Negative:**
- Limited to Expo-compatible native modules
- Larger bundle size
- Some platform-specific limitations

## 2024-11: Hono + tRPC Backend

**ID:** DEC-001  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Category:** Technology  

### Decision
Selected Hono as the backend framework with tRPC for type-safe API communication.

### Context
Needed a lightweight, performant backend framework with excellent TypeScript support and type safety between frontend and backend.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- End-to-end type safety
- Lightweight and fast
- Excellent developer experience
- Auto-generated API types

**Negative:**
- Less mature ecosystem than Express
- Fewer middleware options
- Learning curve for team

## Future Decisions Needed

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Options:** DataDog, New Relic, Grafana + Prometheus
- **Considerations:** Cost, ease of integration, feature set
- **Timeline:** Before Phase 2

### Caching Layer
- **Options:** Redis, Memcached, In-memory
- **Considerations:** Scalability, persistence needs, complexity
- **Timeline:** Phase 2

### CDN Provider
- **Options:** CloudFlare, Fastly, CloudFront
- **Considerations:** Cost, features, integration with GCP
- **Timeline:** Phase 2

### Database Scaling
- **Options:** Read replicas, sharding, managed service
- **Considerations:** Cost, complexity, performance needs
- **Timeline:** When approaching 10k users
