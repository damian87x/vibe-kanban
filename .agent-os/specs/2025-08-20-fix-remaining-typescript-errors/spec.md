# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Fix Remaining TypeScript Errors After Workspace Refactoring
> Created: 2025-08-20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Complete the workspace refactoring by fixing the remaining ~993 TypeScript errors that persist after the initial import path restructuring. This will ensure the codebase compiles cleanly and maintains type safety across both backend and frontend packages.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Improvement

As a developer, I want the codebase to compile without TypeScript errors, so that I can focus on feature development instead of fixing compilation issues and have confidence that the refactoring is complete.

**Detailed Workflow:** After running `npm run type-check`, the command should complete successfully with no TypeScript errors, allowing developers to proceed with normal development workflow including building, testing, and deploying the application.

### Code Quality Assurance

As a team lead, I want to ensure the workspace refactoring is fully complete, so that the codebase maintains high code quality standards and the new monorepo structure works correctly.

**Detailed Workflow:** Verify that all import paths are correctly mapped, missing utilities are properly implemented, and test configurations are updated to work with the new workspace structure.

## Spec Scope

1. **Import Path Resolution** - Fix any remaining import path issues that weren't caught by the initial sed replacements
2. **Missing Utility Implementation** - Create or move any remaining utility functions that are referenced but missing
3. **Test Configuration Updates** - Update test configurations and mocks to work with the new workspace structure
4. **Type Definition Alignment** - Ensure all type definitions are properly accessible and aligned between packages
5. **Build Process Verification** - Verify that both backend and frontend can build and test successfully

## Out of Scope

- Adding new features or functionality
- Changing the existing workspace structure
- Modifying the core architecture
- Performance optimizations
- UI/UX improvements

## Expected Deliverable

1. A codebase that compiles without TypeScript errors when running `npm run type-check`
2. Both backend and frontend packages can build and test successfully
3. All import paths use the new workspace structure consistently
