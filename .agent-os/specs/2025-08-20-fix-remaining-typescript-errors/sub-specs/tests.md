# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-20-fix-remaining-typescript-errors/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-20
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**TypeScript Compilation**
- Verify that `npm run type-check` completes without errors
- Test that both backend and frontend packages compile individually
- Ensure all import paths resolve correctly

**Import Path Resolution**
- Test that all `@backend/*` imports resolve to correct files
- Test that all `@frontend/*` imports resolve to correct files
- Verify that relative imports are properly converted to absolute imports

### Integration Tests

**Workspace Build Process**
- Test that `npm run build` works for both packages
- Verify that workspace scripts execute correctly
- Test that dependencies are properly resolved across packages

**Package Dependencies**
- Verify that each package has access to its required dependencies
- Test that shared utilities are accessible where needed
- Ensure no circular dependencies exist

### Mocking Requirements

**Test Environment Setup**
- Mock any external services that may cause compilation issues
- Ensure test configurations work with new workspace structure
- Mock file system operations if needed for import resolution tests

### Verification Tests

**End-to-End Compilation**
- Run full workspace type check and verify zero errors
- Test that both packages can be built and tested independently
- Verify that all existing functionality still works after fixes
