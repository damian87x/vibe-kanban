# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-20-fix-remaining-typescript-errors/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-20
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Fix all remaining TypeScript compilation errors in both backend and frontend packages
- Ensure import paths use the new workspace structure consistently
- Update test configurations to work with the new monorepo layout
- Verify that all utility functions are properly accessible
- Maintain type safety across package boundaries

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Systematic Error Analysis and Fix (Selected)
- Pros: Comprehensive coverage, addresses root causes, maintains code quality
- Cons: May take longer, requires careful analysis of each error type

**Option B:** Quick Fix with Type Assertions
- Pros: Faster implementation, immediate compilation success
- Cons: Reduces type safety, masks underlying issues, technical debt

**Option C:** Selective Error Suppression
- Pros: Very fast, minimal code changes
- Cons: Poor type safety, doesn't address root causes, maintenance issues

**Rationale:** Option A is selected because it maintains the high code quality standards established in the refactoring while ensuring the workspace structure is properly implemented. The systematic approach will prevent future issues and provide a solid foundation for continued development.

## External Dependencies

- **No new dependencies required** - This spec focuses on fixing existing code rather than adding new functionality
- **Justification:** The goal is to resolve compilation issues using the existing toolchain and dependencies that are already properly configured in the workspace
