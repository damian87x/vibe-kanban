# Integration Health Monitoring - Implementation Summary

## üìã Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Database Infrastructure**
   - Created migration: `008_create_integration_health_tables.sql`
   - Tables: health_checks, health_history (partitioned), alerts, metrics
   - Proper indexes and foreign key constraints

2. **Backend Services**
   - `IntegrationHealthService`: Core health checking logic
   - `HealthCheckScheduler`: Background job management
   - `AlertingService`: Email, webhook, and Slack alerts
   - Service-specific health checks for Gmail, Calendar, Slack

3. **API Endpoints**
   - tRPC router: `integration-health.ts`
   - Endpoints: getHealth, triggerCheck, getAllHealth, getSystemMetrics
   - Rate limiting on manual checks (1/minute)

4. **Frontend Components**
   - `IntegrationHealthStatus`: Reusable health status component
   - Health dashboard page at `/integrations/health`
   - Real-time status updates with 30-second refresh
   - Manual check triggers with loading states

5. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Email alerts via SMTP (configurable)
   - Webhook support for external monitoring
   - Alert cooldown to prevent spam
   - Event-driven architecture for extensibility

6. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for IntegrationHealthService
   - Mock MCP client for testing
   - Coverage for all service methods

7. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive user guide
   - API documentation
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Architecture diagrams

### üîÑ Pending Enhancement (WebSocket)

The WebSocket implementation for real-time updates is marked as pending. The current implementation uses polling (30-second intervals) which is sufficient for most use cases. WebSocket can be added later for true real-time updates.

### üöÄ How to Use

1. **Start Backend with Health Monitoring**
   ```bash
   npm run start:backend
   # Health monitoring starts automatically
   ```

2. **View Health Dashboard**
   - Navigate to `/integrations/health` in the app
   - See real-time status of all integrations
   - Trigger manual checks as needed

3. **Configure Alerts**
   - Set SMTP environment variables for email alerts
   - Configure webhook URLs for external monitoring
   - Alerts trigger automatically based on rules

### üìä Key Metrics

- Health checks run every 5 minutes (healthy) to 60 minutes (unhealthy)
- Response time tracking with P95/P99 percentiles
- Uptime percentage calculation
- Historical data retained for 30 days (detailed) + forever (aggregated)

### üîß Configuration

```env
# Core settings
HEALTH_MONITORING_ENABLED=true

# Email alerts
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@taskpilot.ai
```

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits

1. **Scalable**: Partitioned tables, efficient queries
2. **Reliable**: Exponential backoff, error handling
3. **Extensible**: Event-driven design, provider abstraction
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear UI, actionable alerts
5. **Production-Ready**: Logging, metrics, graceful shutdown

### üìù Notes for Next Developer

- The health monitoring system is designed to be provider-agnostic
- Uses the existing MCP client abstraction (Composio/Klavis)
- Can easily add new health check types or alert channels
- Database migrations are incremental (version 008)
- Frontend components use React Query for state management

This implementation provides a solid foundation for monitoring integration health in production, with room for future enhancements like predictive analytics and custom health criteria.
