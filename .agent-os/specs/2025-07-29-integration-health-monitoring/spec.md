# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Integration Health Monitoring System
> Created: 2025-07-29
> Status: Planning
> Priority: P1 - Critical for Production Reliability

## Overview

Currently, there's no centralized way to monitor the health and status of connected integrations. Users experience integration failures without clear feedback, and administrators have no visibility into system-wide integration health. This spec defines a comprehensive integration health monitoring system that provides real-time status updates, historical metrics, and proactive failure detection.

## User Stories

### User Monitoring Integration Health
As a user, I want to see the real-time health status of my connected integrations so that I know when services are available and can troubleshoot issues quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard shows green/yellow/red status for each integration
- Last successful sync timestamp is displayed
- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- Can manually trigger health check for any integration

### Administrator System Health Dashboard
As an administrator, I want to monitor system-wide integration health so that I can identify provider-level issues and maintain service reliability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- View aggregate health metrics across all users
- Provider-level success/failure rates
- Historical trend visualization (last 24h, 7d, 30d)
- Alert configuration for failure thresholds

### Automated Health Checks
As a system operator, I want automated health checks running continuously so that integration issues are detected proactively before users notice.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Health checks run every 5 minutes per integration
- Failed checks trigger exponential backoff retry
- System logs detailed failure information
- Webhooks can be configured for critical failures

### Integration Recovery Actions
As a user, I want clear recovery actions when an integration fails so that I can quickly restore functionality without technical knowledge.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- One-click re-authentication for OAuth failures
- Clear error messages with resolution steps
- Automatic recovery attempts for transient failures
- Support documentation links for common issues

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

1. **Health Check Infrastructure**
   - Background job system for periodic health checks
   - Per-integration health check implementation
   - Configurable check intervals and timeouts
   - Health status persistence and history

2. **User-Facing Dashboard**
   - Integration status widget on main dashboard
   - Detailed integration health page
   - Real-time status updates via WebSocket
   - Manual health check triggers

3. **Admin Monitoring Portal**
   - System-wide health metrics dashboard
   - Provider-level aggregated statistics
   - Historical trend analysis
   - Export capabilities for reports

4. **Alerting System**
   - Email notifications for critical failures
   - Webhook support for external monitoring
   - Configurable alert thresholds
   - Alert suppression and batching

5. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Automated retry with exponential backoff
   - OAuth token refresh automation
   - Re-authentication flow triggers
   - Self-healing for transient issues

### Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of integration architecture
- Custom monitoring for each tool within integrations
- Third-party monitoring service integration (DataDog, etc.)
- Mobile app push notifications
- Integration performance optimization

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Database Schema** for health tracking:
   - `integration_health_checks` table
   - `integration_health_history` table
   - `health_check_alerts` table

2. **Backend Services**:
   - `IntegrationHealthService` for health checks
   - `HealthCheckScheduler` for job management
   - `AlertingService` for notifications

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/integrations/:id/health` - Current health status
   - `POST /api/integrations/:id/health/check` - Trigger manual check
   - `GET /api/admin/integrations/health` - System-wide metrics
   - `GET /api/integrations/:id/health/history` - Historical data

4. **Frontend Components**:
   - `IntegrationHealthStatus` component
   - `IntegrationHealthDashboard` page
   - `AdminHealthMonitoring` page
   - Real-time status updates

5. **Background Jobs**:
   - Periodic health check job
   - Alert processing job
   - Health history cleanup job

## Technical Requirements

### Health Check Implementation

Each integration type will have specific health checks:

**Gmail Integration:**
- Verify OAuth token validity
- Test `messages.list` with limit=1
- Check quota usage if available

**Calendar Integration:**
- Verify OAuth token validity
- Test `events.list` for primary calendar
- Validate write permissions

**Slack Integration:**
- Test WebSocket connection
- Verify bot token permissions
- Check workspace access

### Performance Requirements

- Health checks complete within 5 seconds
- Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds
- Real-time updates within 1 second of status change
- Support 10,000+ integration checks per hour

### Data Retention

- Keep detailed health data for 30 days
- Aggregate older data to hourly summaries
- Retain monthly summaries indefinitely

### Security Considerations

- Health check results must not expose sensitive data
- Admin portal requires separate authentication
- API rate limiting on manual health checks
- Audit logging for all admin actions

## Success Metrics

1. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for health monitoring system
2. **Performance**: Average health check latency < 2 seconds
3. **User Satisfaction**: 50% reduction in integration-related support tickets
4. **Proactive Detection**: 80% of issues detected before user reports
5. **Recovery Time**: Average integration recovery time < 5 minutes

## Migration Strategy

1. Deploy health check infrastructure without UI
2. Run health checks in shadow mode for 1 week
3. Gradually enable UI features per user cohort
4. Full rollout after stability verification

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for predictive failure detection
- Integration performance scoring
- Automated troubleshooting workflows
- Integration usage analytics
- SLA monitoring and reporting
