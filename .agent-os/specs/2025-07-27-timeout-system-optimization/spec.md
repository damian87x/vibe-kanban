# Timeout System Optimization Specification

> **Specification ID**: 2025-07-27-timeout-system-optimization  
> **Created**: 2025-07-27  
> **Status**: Ready for Implementation  
> **Priority**: Critical  
> **Estimated Effort**: 4 weeks  

## Overview

Fix critical timeout issues in the Claude/chat system causing production timeouts and poor user experience. The current system has inconsistent timeout handling across different layers, with AI provider requests being the primary source of timeouts.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
1. **AI Provider Timeouts**: 30-second timeout insufficient for complex operations
2. **Frontend Request Hanging**: No timeout configuration causing indefinite waits
3. **Tool Chain Delays**: Sequential processing causing cumulative timeout issues
4. **Database Connection Issues**: 10-second timeout may be insufficient for complex queries
5. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Poor user feedback for timeout scenarios

### Impact
- Users experiencing timeouts on complex AI operations
- Frontend hangs during long-running requests
- Tool executions failing due to cumulative delays
- Poor user experience with unclear error messages

## User Stories

### As a User
- **US-1**: As a user, I want complex AI conversations to complete successfully without timing out, so I can get answers to complex questions
- **US-2**: As a user, I want clear feedback when operations are taking longer than usual, so I understand what's happening
- **US-3**: As a user, I want the option to cancel long-running requests, so I'm not stuck waiting indefinitely
- **US-4**: As a user, I want tool executions to work reliably even for complex workflows, so my automations complete successfully

### As a Developer
- **US-5**: As a developer, I want a centralized timeout configuration system, so I can manage timeouts consistently
- **US-6**: As a developer, I want adaptive timeouts based on operation complexity, so the system optimizes itself
- **US-7**: As a developer, I want comprehensive timeout monitoring, so I can identify and fix timeout issues proactively

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Adaptive Timeout Configuration System
- **Centralized timeout configuration** with environment variable overrides
- **Operation-based timeout calculation** considering complexity factors
- **Dynamic timeout adjustment** based on historical performance
- **Fallback timeout values** for unknown operations

### 2. Enhanced Frontend Request Handling
- **AbortController implementation** for request cancellation
- **Progressive timeout warnings** to inform users of long operations
- **Retry mechanisms** with exponential backoff
- **User-friendly timeout error messages**

### 3. Parallel Tool Execution System
- **Concurrent tool execution** to reduce cumulative delays
- **Individual tool timeouts** to prevent single tool from blocking chain
- **Partial success handling** allowing some tools to fail while others succeed
- **Tool execution progress tracking**

### 4. Improved AI Provider Integration
- **Dynamic timeout calculation** based on context length and complexity
- **Model-specific timeout configuration** for different AI providers
- **Streaming response handling** for real-time feedback
- **Circuit breaker pattern** for provider availability

### 5. Database Performance Optimization
- **Connection pool optimization** with adaptive timeouts
- **Query-specific timeout configuration** based on complexity
- **Connection health monitoring** with automatic recovery
- **Query performance tracking**
