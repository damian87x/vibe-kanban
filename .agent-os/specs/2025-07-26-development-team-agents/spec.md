# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Development Team Agents
> Created: 2025-07-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create specialized AI agents for development team workflows including QA testing, architectural review, code review, DevOps automation, and performance optimization. These agents will be stored in the `.claude/agents/` directory and leverage Claude Code's sub-agent functionality to provide automated assistance throughout the development lifecycle.

## User Stories

### QA Specialist Agent

As a developer, I want an AI QA specialist that can automatically test my features and verify implementations, so that I can catch bugs early and ensure quality standards are met without manual testing overhead.

The QA agent will automatically run comprehensive testing workflows when code changes are detected, including unit tests, integration tests, E2E testing with Playwright, and feature verification. It will generate detailed test reports and highlight any failures or missing test coverage.

### Architecture Review Agent

As a technical lead, I want an AI architect that can review system design decisions and suggest improvements, so that our codebase maintains consistency and follows best practices without requiring constant manual review.

The architecture agent will analyze code changes for architectural patterns, identify potential design issues, suggest improvements for scalability and maintainability, and ensure consistency with established tech stack standards.

### Code Review Agent

As a developer, I want an AI code reviewer that provides detailed feedback on my pull requests, so that I can improve code quality and learn best practices without waiting for human reviewers.

The code review agent will analyze code changes for style consistency, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, documentation quality, and adherence to project standards, providing actionable feedback and suggestions.

## Spec Scope

1. **QA Specialist Agent** - Automated testing workflows with comprehensive test execution and reporting
2. **Architecture Review Agent** - System design analysis and architectural guidance for scalability
3. **Code Review Agent** - Automated code quality analysis with security and performance feedback
4. **DevOps Engineer Agent** - Infrastructure automation, deployment verification, and monitoring setup
5. **Performance Engineer Agent** - Application optimization analysis and performance monitoring recommendations

## Out of Scope

- Replacing human code reviewers entirely (agents provide assistance, not replacement)
- Real-time code editing or automatic code fixes without user approval
- Production deployment automation (DevOps agent focuses on verification and guidance)
- Direct integration with external CI/CD systems beyond the current GitHub Actions setup

## Expected Deliverable

1. Five specialized agent files in `.claude/agents/` directory with clear instructions and capabilities
2. Agent integration with existing MCP servers (Ref, Playwright, Pieces) for enhanced functionality
3. Comprehensive documentation for each agent's usage patterns and workflow integration
