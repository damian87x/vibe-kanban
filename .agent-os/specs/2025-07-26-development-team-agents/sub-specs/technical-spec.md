# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-26-development-team-agents/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-26
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Agent Architecture
- Each agent will be implemented as a Claude Code sub-agent using markdown configuration files
- Agents will be stored in `.claude/agents/` directory with structured instructions
- Each agent will have access to relevant MCP servers for enhanced functionality
- Agents will integrate with existing project workflows and standards

### File Structure Requirements
- Agent files will follow naming convention: `{role}-agent.md` (e.g., `qa-specialist-agent.md`)
- Each agent file will contain structured instructions, capabilities, and workflow guidance
- Agents will reference existing project standards from `.agent-os/standards/`
- Integration with MCP servers will be explicitly defined in agent capabilities

### MCP Server Integration
- **Ref MCP Server**: For documentation search and best practices lookup
- **Playwright MCP Server**: For automated browser testing and E2E verification
- **Pieces MCP Server**: For querying past decisions and maintaining project context
- **Filesystem MCP Server**: For code analysis and file operations
- **Exa Search MCP Server**: For finding recent development patterns and solutions

### Performance Criteria
- Agents must provide actionable feedback within 30 seconds for code analysis
- Test execution workflows should complete within 5 minutes for full test suite
- Agents should maintain context between related tasks within the same session
- Memory usage should not exceed 500MB per agent instance

## Approach Options

**Option A: Individual Agent Files with Shared Utilities**
- Pros: Clear separation of concerns, easy to maintain individual agents, modular approach
- Cons: Potential code duplication, more files to manage

**Option B: Unified Agent System with Role Switching** (Selected)
- Pros: Shared utilities, consistent interface, easier to maintain consistency
- Cons: More complex initial setup, potential coupling between roles

**Option C: Database-Stored Agent Templates**
- Pros: Dynamic configuration, easier to extend
- Cons: Over-engineered for current needs, adds complexity

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of functionality and maintainability while leveraging Claude Code's sub-agent system effectively.

## External Dependencies

- **Claude Code Sub-Agent System** - Core platform for agent functionality
- **Existing MCP Servers** - Already integrated (Ref, Playwright, Pieces, Filesystem, Exa)
- **Project Standards Framework** - Existing `.agent-os/standards/` documentation

**Justification:** All dependencies are already available in the project, requiring no additional external integrations.

## Implementation Details

### Agent Capabilities Framework
Each agent will implement:
1. **Context Analysis**: Understanding current project state and requirements
2. **Action Execution**: Performing specific tasks within their domain
3. **Feedback Generation**: Providing structured, actionable recommendations
4. **Integration Hooks**: Connecting with relevant MCP servers and project tools

### Quality Assurance Integration
- Integration with existing Jest test suite and Playwright E2E tests
- Automatic test discovery and execution
- Coverage reporting and gap analysis
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

### Security Considerations
- Agents will respect existing project security standards
- No automatic code modification without explicit user approval
- Secure handling of sensitive project information
- Audit trail for all agent actions and recommendations
