# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Knowledge Base RAG System
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for the knowledge base that enables AI-powered semantic search and contextual document retrieval. This feature will transform TaskPilot's chat assistant from a generic AI to a personalized assistant that leverages user documents and notes for more accurate, context-aware responses.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Business Professional Document Search

As a business professional, I want to ask questions about my uploaded documents and get accurate answers based on their content, so that I can quickly find information without manually searching through files.

When I upload a PDF report about Q4 sales and ask "What were our top performing regions last quarter?", the AI assistant searches through my documents using semantic understanding and provides the answer with references to the specific document and page number. This saves me from opening multiple files and searching manually, reducing a 10-minute task to a 10-second query.

### Story 2: Knowledge-Enhanced Task Automation

As a TaskPilot user, I want the AI to automatically use my stored knowledge when executing tasks, so that my automated workflows are personalized and context-aware.

When I ask the AI to "Draft an email to the team about our product roadmap", it automatically searches my knowledge base for relevant documents about product plans, previous roadmap communications, and team structure. The resulting email draft incorporates actual details from my documents rather than generic content, making the automation truly useful for my specific context.

### Story 3: Multi-Document Synthesis

As a project manager, I want to ask complex questions that require information from multiple documents, so that I can get comprehensive insights without manual correlation.

When I ask "How does our current project timeline compare to the original proposal?", the system searches across project proposals, status updates, and timeline documents, synthesizing information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive comparison. This cross-document analysis would typically take 30+ minutes manually but is completed in seconds.

## Spec Scope

1. **pgvector Extension Integration** - Enable PostgreSQL vector search capabilities with pgvector extension and migration of existing JSONB embeddings
2. **Embedding Pipeline** - Implement document chunking, embedding generation with OpenAI ada-002, and vector storage pipeline
3. **Hybrid Search System** - Combine vector similarity search (70%) with full-text search (30%) for optimal retrieval
4. **Knowledge Tool for AI** - Create OpenRouter-compatible tool definition for knowledge base access in chat
5. **Document Processing Enhancement** - Upgrade existing document processing with smart chunking and metadata extraction

## Out of Scope

- Multi-modal embeddings (images, audio)
- Real-time collaborative document editing
- External knowledge base connections (Wikipedia, etc.)
- Document versioning and change tracking
- Custom embedding model training

## Expected Deliverable

1. AI assistant can answer questions using uploaded documents with 90%+ accuracy on test queries
2. Knowledge search tool appears in chat interface and executes within 2 seconds
3. Existing documents are migrated and searchable through the new vector system
