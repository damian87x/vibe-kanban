# Tasks for Fix Register Console Error

## Immediate Fix (P0 - 1 hour)

### Phase 1: Locate and Fix Console Usage
- [x] Search for console.log usage in registration flow
  - [x] Check app/(auth)/register.tsx
  - [x] Check shared auth components
  - [x] Search for onPress handlers in auth flow
  - [x] Identify the exact line causing the error

- [x] Remove or wrap console statements
  - [x] Comment out console.log in production code
  - [x] Add conditional checks if needed
  - [x] Test locally to ensure fix works
  - [x] Verify no other console usage in critical paths

### Phase 2: Deploy and Verify
- [x] Deploy fix to cloud
  - [x] Build production bundle
  - [x] Deploy to Cloud Run
  - [x] Monitor deployment logs
  - [x] Test registration immediately

## Complete Solution (P1 - 4 hours)

### Phase 3: Implement Logger Utility
- [x] Create logger utility
  - [x] Create utils/logger.ts
  - [x] Implement safe logging methods
  - [x] Add development/production checks
  - [x] Export logger interface

- [x] Replace console usage throughout codebase
  - [x] Search all console.* usage
  - [x] Replace with logger calls
  - [x] Update import statements
  - [x] Test affected components

### Phase 4: Build Configuration
- [x] Update build configuration
  - [x] Install babel-plugin-transform-remove-console
  - [x] Update babel.config.js
  - [ ] Test production builds locally
  - [ ] Verify console stripped in bundles

- [x] Add linting rules
  - [x] Configure ESLint no-console rule
  - [x] Add rule exceptions for logger utility
  - [ ] Fix any linting errors
  - [ ] Add to CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 5: Testing
- [x] Write unit tests
  - [ ] Test registration form without console
  - [x] Test logger utility functionality
  - [x] Test error handling paths
  - [ ] Verify no console in production

- [ ] Write E2E tests
  - [ ] Create Puppeteer test for registration
  - [ ] Test with mocked console object
  - [ ] Verify full registration flow
  - [ ] Add to test suite

### Phase 6: Documentation
- [ ] Update documentation
  - [ ] Document logger utility usage
  - [ ] Add to development guidelines
  - [ ] Update troubleshooting guide
  - [ ] Create console usage policy

## Success Metrics

- [x] Registration works on production without errors
- [x] No console-related errors in browser logs
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Zero console statements in production bundle (only error/warn preserved)
- [x] Logger utility adopted across codebase

## Rollback Plan

If the fix causes issues:
1. Revert to previous deployment
2. Add try-catch around console usage as temporary fix
3. Deploy minimal fix first
4. Implement complete solution in stages

## Notes

- Priority: P0 (Critical - Blocking Production)
- Estimated Time: 5-6 hours total
- Resources Needed: Developer with deployment access
- Testing Required: Manual and automated on production
