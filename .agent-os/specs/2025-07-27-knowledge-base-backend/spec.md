# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Knowledge Base Backend Integration
> Created: 2025-07-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive backend system for the Knowledge Base feature that enables document storage, retrieval, and AI-powered search capabilities. This system will allow users to upload documents and enable the AI chat to reference and use this knowledge when answering questions.

## User Stories

### Document Management

As a business user, I want to upload and organize my documents in the knowledge base, so that I can centralize my important information and have the AI assistant reference it when needed.

Users will upload documents through the Knowledge Base tab, organize them by categories, and the system will process and store them for future retrieval. When users ask questions in the AI chat, the assistant will automatically search and reference relevant documents from their knowledge base.

### AI-Powered Knowledge Retrieval

As a user interacting with the AI assistant, I want the AI to automatically search and reference my uploaded documents when answering questions, so that I get contextually relevant responses based on my organization's specific knowledge.

When a user asks a question like "What's our vacation policy?" or "Show me the Q3 sales report", the AI will search through their knowledge base, find relevant documents, and provide answers with citations to the source documents.

### Team Knowledge Sharing

As a team lead, I want to share specific documents with my team members, so that everyone has access to the same organizational knowledge and the AI provides consistent answers across the team.

Team members can access shared documents and the AI will consider both personal and team knowledge bases when responding to queries.

## Spec Scope

1. **Database Schema** - Design and implement PostgreSQL tables for documents, categories, and vector embeddings
2. **File Storage Integration** - Implement AWS S3 integration for secure document storage with presigned URLs
3. **Vector Search System** - Implement vector embeddings and similarity search using pgvector for semantic document retrieval
4. **API Endpoints** - Create tRPC routes for document CRUD operations, search, and AI integration
5. **AI Chat Integration** - Modify chat system to query knowledge base and include relevant context in AI prompts

## Out of Scope

- Document editing capabilities (view-only for now)
- Complex permission systems beyond user/team level
- OCR for scanned documents
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Version control for documents

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can upload documents through the Knowledge Base UI and see them organized by categories
2. AI assistant automatically searches and references knowledge base documents when answering questions
3. Search functionality returns relevant documents based on semantic similarity
4. Documents are securely stored in S3 with proper access controls
