# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Template-Chat Integration Architecture
> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a robust architecture that seamlessly integrates agent templates with the chat assistant, creating persistent agent sessions with dynamic prompt generation and proper lifecycle management. This addresses critical gaps in how templates transition to chat conversations and how agent context is maintained throughout the user experience.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Seamless Agent Execution

As a user, I want to execute an agent from a template and have it seamlessly transition to a chat conversation with full context, so that I don't need to manually set up the agent's capabilities and goals.

The workflow involves:
1. Selecting an agent template from the gallery
2. Clicking "Run Agent" to start execution
3. Automatic creation of an agent session with persistent state
4. Seamless transition to chat with dynamic prompt based on template
5. Full visibility of agent progress and ability to intervene
6. Conversation history showing agent session context

### Story 2: Persistent Agent Sessions

As a user, I want my agent sessions to persist across browser restarts and maintain their state, so that I can resume complex workflows without losing progress.

The experience includes:
1. Starting an agent session from a template
2. Agent begins multi-step workflow execution
3. Browser closes or refreshes unexpectedly
4. Upon return, agent session resumes from last checkpoint
5. Conversation history shows all sessions grouped by agent
6. Clear status indicators for running, paused, and completed sessions

### Story 3: Dynamic Context-Aware Prompts

As a power user, I want agents to have dynamic prompts that automatically adapt to their template's capabilities, integrations, and current workflow state, so that agents behave intelligently based on their designed purpose.

This enables:
1. Agent prompts automatically include template capabilities
2. Integration tools are discovered and included in context
3. Workflow steps guide agent behavior
4. User preferences modify agent responses
5. Context evolves as workflow progresses

## Spec Scope

1. **Agent Session Management** - Persistent, stateful agent sessions with lifecycle management
2. **Dynamic Prompt Generator** - Template-based prompt generation with integration mapping
3. **Template-Chat Bridge Service** - Seamless transition from template selection to chat
4. **Enhanced Conversation Organization** - Session-aware grouping and status tracking
5. **Execution Control System** - Start, pause, resume, and monitor agent execution

## Out of Scope

- Multi-agent collaboration and coordination
- Custom template builder UI
- Agent marketplace or sharing features
- Voice or alternative input methods for agents
- Cross-user agent session sharing

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can execute agents that maintain persistent sessions across browser restarts
2. Agent conversations show clear context including source template and current status
3. Dynamic prompts automatically adapt to template capabilities and integrations
4. Users have full control to pause, resume, and monitor agent execution
