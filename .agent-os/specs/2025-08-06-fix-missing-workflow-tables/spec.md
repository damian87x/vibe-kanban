> Spec: Fix Missing Workflow Tables
> Created: 2025-08-06
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the PostgreSQL database error caused by missing workflow tables that prevent users from accessing the workflows functionality. The error indicates that the `user_workflows` table doesn't exist in the database, causing tRPC query failures.

## User Stories

### Database Table Creation

As a developer, I want to ensure all required workflow tables exist in the database, so that users can create, manage, and execute workflows without errors.

When users navigate to the workflows page, they currently encounter an error because the `user_workflows` table referenced in the query doesn't exist. The application needs the proper database schema to store user workflows, workflow templates, and execution history.

### Workflow Management Restoration

As a user, I want to access the workflows page and manage my automation workflows, so that I can create and execute automated tasks through the application.

Users should be able to navigate to `/workflows`, view their existing workflows, create new ones from templates, and track execution history without encountering database errors.

## Spec Scope

1. **Database Migration Execution** - Run the existing migration files to create the missing workflow-related tables
2. **Migration Verification** - Verify that all workflow tables (`user_workflows`, `workflow_templates`, `workflow_executions`) are created successfully
3. **Connection Testing** - Test that the tRPC endpoints can successfully query the new tables
4. **Error Resolution** - Ensure the workflows page loads without database errors

## Out of Scope

- Creating new workflow features or functionality
- Modifying existing workflow business logic
- Adding new columns or tables beyond what's in existing migrations
- Implementing workflow execution engine improvements

## Expected Deliverable

1. All workflow-related database tables are created and accessible
2. The workflows page (`/workflows`) loads without database errors
3. Users can successfully query their workflows through the tRPC endpoints
