> Spec: Codebase Quick Win Improvements
> Created: 2025-07-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement high-impact, low-risk improvements to enhance code quality, security, performance, and developer experience across the rork-getden-ai-workspace codebase. These quick wins focus on immediate value with minimal disruption to existing functionality.

## User Stories

### Code Quality and Maintainability

As a developer, I want to have consistent logging throughout the codebase, so that I can debug issues effectively and monitor application behavior in production.

The workflow involves replacing all console.log/warn/error statements with the existing logger utility, which already handles production environments gracefully and prevents console errors.

### Security Enhancement

As a security-conscious developer, I want to ensure no API keys are hardcoded in the codebase, so that sensitive credentials are never exposed in version control.

This involves moving the hardcoded Klavis API key found in test files to environment variables and implementing validation for all required environment variables at startup.

### Performance Optimization

As a user, I want the OAuth integration status to update efficiently without excessive API calls, so that the application performs well and provides a smooth experience.

The implementation will add proper cleanup to polling mechanisms, implement debouncing, and optimize connection state management in the integrations component.

## Spec Scope

1. **Console to Logger Migration** - Replace 242+ console statements with the existing logger utility using automated scripts
2. **Security Hardening** - Remove hardcoded API keys and add environment variable validation at startup
3. **OAuth Polling Optimization** - Implement proper cleanup, debouncing, and connection state management
4. **Dead Code Removal** - Remove unused dependencies, deprecated methods, and clean up TODO comments
5. **Type Safety Improvements** - Replace critical `any` types with proper interfaces in high-impact areas

## Out of Scope

- Major architectural refactoring
- Breaking changes to existing APIs
- Complete TypeScript strict mode migration
- Full test coverage implementation (only critical paths)
- Large file splitting (deferred to future refactoring)

## Expected Deliverable

1. All console statements replaced with logger utility, verified by grep search showing zero console.* usage
2. No hardcoded credentials in codebase, all sensitive values loaded from environment with startup validation
3. OAuth polling shows reduced API calls in network tab and proper cleanup on component unmount
