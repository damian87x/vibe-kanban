- [ ] 5. Type Safety Quick Wins
  - [ ] 5.1 Identify critical `any` types in API handlers
  - [ ] 5.2 Create interface definitions for API responses
  - [ ] 5.3 Replace `any` types in event handlers
  - [ ] 5.4 Add types for third-party library usage
  - [ ] 5.5 Create shared type definitions file
  - [ ] 5.6 Verify TypeScript compilation succeeds

## Implementation Order

The tasks are ordered by priority and risk:
1. **Security first** - Removes immediate vulnerability
2. **Console migration** - Low risk with high impact
3. **OAuth optimization** - Improves user experience
4. **Dead code removal** - Cleans up technical debt
5. **Type safety** - Enhances code quality

Each task includes writing tests first (TDD approach) to ensure quality and prevent regressions.
