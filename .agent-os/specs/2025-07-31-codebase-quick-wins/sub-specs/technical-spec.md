# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-31-codebase-quick-wins/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-31
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Console to Logger Migration
- Create an automated script to replace console.* statements with logger.* equivalents
- Preserve original message formatting and arguments
- Handle different console methods (log, warn, error, info, debug)
- Ensure proper import statements are added where needed
- Maintain functionality in development mode

### Security Hardening
- Move hardcoded Klavis API key from `scripts/check-klavis-methods.ts` to environment variable
- Create startup validation module to check all required environment variables
- Provide clear error messages when variables are missing
- Document all required environment variables in .env.example

### OAuth Polling Optimization
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks to cancel polling on unmount
- Add connection state management to prevent redundant API calls
- Implement exponential backoff with maximum retry limits
- Add debouncing for rapid state changes
- Monitor and log polling behavior for debugging

### Code Quality Improvements
- Remove unused dependencies identified in package.json
- Delete deprecated methods marked with comments
- Convert high-priority TODO comments to GitHub issues or implement fixes
- Add error boundaries to critical user-facing components

### Type Safety Enhancements
- Focus on replacing `any` types in:
  - API response handlers
  - Event handlers
  - Third-party library integrations
  - Critical business logic functions
- Create reusable type definitions for common patterns

## Approach Options

**Option A: Manual Implementation**
- Pros: Full control, careful review of each change
- Cons: Time-consuming, error-prone, inconsistent

**Option B: Automated Scripts with Manual Review** (Selected)
- Pros: Fast, consistent, reversible with git
- Cons: Requires careful script development and testing

**Rationale:** Automated approach with manual review provides the best balance of speed and safety. Scripts can be tested on small subsets before full execution.

## Implementation Details

### Console Replacement Script
```typescript
// Script will:
1. Parse TypeScript/JavaScript files with AST
2. Identify console.* calls
3. Replace with appropriate logger.* calls
4. Add import statement if missing
5. Preserve original formatting
```

### Environment Validation Module
```typescript
// At startup:
1. Define required variables schema
2. Check each variable exists and is non-empty
3. Validate format where applicable (URLs, API keys)
4. Throw clear errors with guidance
```

### OAuth Polling Optimization
```typescript
// Improvements:
1. Store cleanup functions in useRef
2. Implement connection pooling
3. Add request deduplication
4. Monitor active connections
```

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. All improvements use existing tools and libraries:
- Existing logger utility at `@/utils/logger`
- Built-in React hooks for cleanup
- Native JavaScript for scripts

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Automated Replacements (Day 1)
1. Run console replacement script on non-critical files first
2. Test application functionality
3. Run on remaining files
4. Commit changes with clear message

### Phase 2: Security & Performance (Day 2)
1. Move API keys to environment variables
2. Add startup validation
3. Implement OAuth polling fixes
4. Test OAuth flows thoroughly

### Phase 3: Cleanup & Polish (Day 3)
1. Remove unused dependencies
2. Clean up deprecated code
3. Add error boundaries
4. Address critical TODOs

## Risk Mitigation

- Create feature branch for all changes
- Test each phase independently
- Keep commits atomic and reversible
- Run full test suite after each phase
- Monitor production logs after deployment
