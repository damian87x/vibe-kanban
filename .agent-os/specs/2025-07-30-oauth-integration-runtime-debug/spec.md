> Spec: OAuth Integration Runtime Debug
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Debug and fix critical runtime and configuration issues in the OAuth integration connection flow that prevent integrations from being properly saved to the database with status='active', blocking conversation agents and workflows from accessing tools.

## User Stories

### Integration Connection Failure Story

As a TaskPilot user, I want to connect my Gmail, Calendar, and Slack accounts through OAuth, so that I can use AI agents to automate tasks across these services.

**Current Broken Workflow:**
1. User navigates to integrations page
2. User clicks "Connect" on Gmail/Calendar/Slack
3. OAuth flow initiates (may work)
4. User completes authorization on provider site
5. Callback returns to application
6. Integration appears disconnected due to runtime issues
7. Conversation agent cannot access tools
8. User experiences failed automation

**Expected Fixed Workflow:**
1. User clicks "Connect" on integration
2. OAuth flow initiates correctly with proper environment configuration
3. User completes authorization
4. Callback properly saves integration to database with status='active'
5. Integration shows as connected in UI
6. Tools become available to conversation agent
7. User can successfully automate tasks

### Integration Status Visibility Story

As a TaskPilot user, I want to see accurate integration status and have robust error handling, so that I can troubleshoot connection issues effectively.

**Current Issues:**
- Integration status checks look for status='active' but integrations aren't saved with this status
- Error messages are generic and don't help with debugging
- No visibility into OAuth callback failures
- Frontend refresh logic has focus-aware issues

**Expected Behavior:**
- Clear integration status display (connected/disconnected/error)
- Detailed error messages for OAuth failures
- Proper focus-aware refresh logic
- Debug information available for troubleshooting

## Spec Scope

1. **OAuth Callback Runtime Fixes** - Resolve configuration issues preventing successful OAuth callback completion and database storage
2. **Integration Status Persistence** - Ensure integrations are properly saved to database with status='active' after successful OAuth
3. **Environment Configuration Debug** - Fix environment variable configuration problems affecting OAuth providers
4. **Focus-Aware Refresh Logic** - Implement robust frontend refresh logic to handle OAuth callback returns
5. **Error Handling Enhancement** - Add comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities for OAuth flow failures

## Out of Scope

- Creating new OAuth providers (Klavis and Composio already exist)
- Changing the fundamental OAuth flow architecture
- Adding new integration services beyond Gmail, Calendar, Slack
- Performance optimization (focus is on functionality)
- UI/UX redesign (focus is on runtime fixes)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **OAuth Callback Success** - OAuth callback successfully saves integration to database with proper status and configuration
2. **Integration Availability** - Tools become available to conversation agent after successful OAuth connection
3. **UI Status Accuracy** - Integration status accurately reflects database state with proper refresh logic
