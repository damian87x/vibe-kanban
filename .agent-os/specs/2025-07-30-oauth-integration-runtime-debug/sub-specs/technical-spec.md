# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-oauth-integration-runtime-debug/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### OAuth Callback Runtime Fixes
- Fix Composio SDK API call failures in `ComposioIntegrationManager`
- Resolve environment variable configuration issues affecting OAuth providers
- Ensure `createOrUpdateIntegration()` properly sets status='active' on successful callback
- Fix hardcoded localhost URLs in production deployment (building on previous fixes)
- Implement proper error propagation from OAuth providers to frontend

### Integration Status Persistence
- Verify database schema supports all required integration fields
- Ensure OAuth callback handler properly updates integration records
- Fix any database transaction issues in integration creation/update flow
- Implement proper rollback mechanisms for failed OAuth completions
- Add integration status validation and consistency checks

### Environment Configuration Debug
- Audit all OAuth-related environment variables across both providers (Klavis/Composio)
- Fix `OAUTH_PROVIDER` switching logic and provider factory initialization
- Ensure production environment variables are properly loaded and validated
- Debug `getFrontendUrl()` configuration for callback URL generation
- Verify SSL/HTTPS configuration for production OAuth callbacks

### Focus-Aware Refresh Logic
- Fix frontend integration status refresh when returning from OAuth provider
- Implement proper window focus detection for OAuth callback handling
- Add retry logic for integration status checks after OAuth completion
- Ensure UI updates reflect database changes without manual refresh
- Handle edge cases like browser tab switching during OAuth flow

### Error Handling Enhancement
- Add detailed logging throughout OAuth flow with request/response tracking
- Implement user-friendly error messages for common OAuth failures
- Add debugging endpoints for OAuth state inspection
- Create comprehensive error codes for different failure scenarios
- Add monitoring and alerting for OAuth success/failure rates

## Approach Options

**Option A: Incremental Debug Approach**
- Pros: Lower risk, can test each fix in isolation, maintains existing architecture
- Cons: May take longer, might miss systemic issues, piecemeal testing

**Option B: Comprehensive OAuth Flow Rewrite** 
- Pros: Clean slate, modern best practices, eliminates legacy issues
- Cons: High risk, significant testing required, potential new bugs

**Option C: Systematic Investigation with Targeted Fixes** (Selected)
- Pros: Balances thoroughness with risk management, focuses on root causes, maintains stability
- Cons: Requires careful analysis, may uncover additional issues

**Rationale:** Option C provides the best balance of fixing root cause issues while maintaining system stability. The OAuth implementation architecture is sound based on code analysis - the issues appear to be configuration and runtime problems rather than fundamental design flaws.

## External Dependencies

**No new dependencies required** - All necessary libraries and frameworks are already in place:
- Existing OAuth provider abstraction (Klavis/Composio)
- Existing database layer and integration management
- Existing frontend state management (Zustand)
- Existing error handling utilities

## Investigation Strategy

### Phase 1: Environment Configuration Audit
1. Verify all environment variables are properly loaded in both development and production
2. Test OAuth provider factory initialization with different OAUTH_PROVIDER values
3. Validate callback URL generation across environments
4. Check SSL/HTTPS configuration for production OAuth flows

### Phase 2: OAuth Flow Runtime Analysis
1. Add comprehensive logging to track OAuth flow from initiation to completion
2. Test OAuth callback handling with real provider responses
3. Verify database integration record creation/update flow
4. Identify specific points where status='active' is not being set

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration Testing
1. Test focus-aware refresh logic with browser tab switching
2. Verify integration status updates after OAuth completion
3. Test error handling and user feedback mechanisms
4. Validate conversation agent tool availability after successful OAuth

### Phase 4: Production Deployment Verification
1. Test OAuth flows in production environment
2. Verify callback URLs work correctly with production domain
3. Test integration persistence and tool availability
4. Monitor OAuth success rates and error patterns
