> Spec: Kanban Workflow Enhancement
> Created: 2025-08-26  
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance Vibe Kanban with batch ticket refinement, environment separation for parallel testing, and multi-agent orchestration with customizable workflows per project. This creates a more sophisticated task management system that leverages specialized agents for development and QA while maintaining simplicity for local development.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Batch Ticket Refinement

As a developer, I want to refine multiple tickets in batches, so that I can efficiently plan and estimate work for entire sprints without context switching between individual tickets.

The workflow involves:
1. Selecting multiple unrefined tickets from the kanban board
2. Initiating batch refinement with a planning agent
3. Agent analyzes related tickets for dependencies and commonalities
4. Generates consistent estimates and implementation approaches
5. Updates all tickets with refined details in one operation
6. Maintains traceability of refinement decisions

### Story 2: Parallel Environment Testing

As a team lead, I want to test multiple feature branches simultaneously in isolated environments, so that QA can proceed in parallel without blocking development.

The experience includes:
1. Creating isolated worktree environments per task/feature
2. Running multiple development servers on different ports
3. QA agent can test each environment independently
4. Results are aggregated and reported per environment
5. Environments are automatically cleaned up after testing
6. Clear visibility of which environments are active

### Story 3: Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration

As a project manager, I want to customize the kanban workflow with specialized agents for different stages, so that each phase of development gets appropriate expertise and validation.

This enables:
1. Assigning specific agents to workflow stages (planning, dev, QA, review)
2. Claude Code CLI integration for agent discovery and loading
3. Agents can hand off work between stages
4. Each project can have its own workflow configuration
5. QA agent independently validates development work
6. Agents maintain their own context and decision logs

## Spec Scope

1. **Batch Refinement System** - Select and refine multiple tickets simultaneously with AI assistance
2. **Environment Isolation Manager** - Create and manage parallel testing environments with automatic cleanup
3. **Agent Registry and Loader** - Discover, load, and manage specialized agents from Claude Code CLI
4. **Workflow Customization Engine** - Configure per-project workflows with agent assignments
5. **QA Agent Integration** - Independent quality assurance agent with automated testing capabilities

## Out of Scope

- Production deployment configurations
- Cloud environment provisioning
- Agent training or fine-tuning
- Cross-project agent sharing
- Real-time collaborative editing
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can select and refine multiple tickets in batch operations with consistent results
2. Multiple isolated environments run in parallel for independent testing
3. Projects have customizable workflows with specialized agents for each stage
4. QA agent independently validates features without blocking development
