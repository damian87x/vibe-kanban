# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-25-fix-registration-form-submission/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-25
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Fix form state management to properly capture input values
- Implement API call to backend registration endpoint
- Handle loading states during submission
- Display error messages from backend
- Redirect on successful registration
- Ensure form works on both web and mobile platforms

## Investigation Findings

From testing both local and production environments:
- Registration button click is being logged: "Register button pressed"
- On local: Form values are captured but no API request is sent
- On production: Form values show as empty (`{name: , email: , passwordLength: 0}`)
- No POST request to `/api/auth/register` is made in either environment
- Backend server is running and accessible at port 3001 (local) 

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Debug existing form submission handler
- Pros: Minimal changes, preserves existing code structure
- Cons: Root cause unclear without seeing the code

**Option B:** Reimplement form submission with proper API integration (Selected)
- Pros: Ensures proper implementation, adds proper error handling
- Cons: Requires more thorough testing

**Rationale:** Given that the form submission is completely broken and values aren't being captured properly on production, a proper reimplementation ensures all edge cases are handled correctly.

## Implementation Details

1. Review current registration form implementation in `app/auth/register.tsx`
2. Check form state management (likely using React hooks)
3. Implement proper form submission handler that:
   - Prevents default form submission
   - Validates all fields
   - Makes POST request to `/api/auth/register`
   - Handles loading/success/error states
4. Ensure tRPC client is properly configured for auth endpoints
5. Add proper TypeScript types for form data and API responses

## External Dependencies

No new dependencies required - the project already has:
- tRPC for API communication
- React Hook Form or similar for form management
- Zod for validation (if using tRPC)
