> Spec: Fix Registration Form Submission
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the registration form submission functionality that is currently not sending API requests when users attempt to create accounts. This critical issue prevents new user signups on both local and production environments.

## User Stories

### User Registration Flow

As a new user, I want to register for TaskPilot AI, so that I can access the application and start using its features.

Currently, when users fill out the registration form with their name, email, and password, then click "Create Account", the button press is logged but no API request is sent to the backend. This leaves users unable to create accounts, blocking them from accessing the application entirely.

## Spec Scope

1. **Frontend Form Submission** - Fix the registration form to properly capture form values and send POST request to `/api/auth/register`
2. **Form Validation** - Ensure proper client-side validation before submission
3. **Error Handling** - Display appropriate error messages for failed registrations
4. **Success Flow** - Redirect users to login or dashboard after successful registration

## Out of Scope

- Backend API changes (the API endpoint exists and works)
- Authentication flow changes
- UI/UX redesign of the registration page
- Password recovery functionality

## Expected Deliverable

1. Registration form successfully sends POST request to `/api/auth/register` with user data
2. New users can create accounts and receive appropriate feedback
3. Form shows validation errors when data is invalid
