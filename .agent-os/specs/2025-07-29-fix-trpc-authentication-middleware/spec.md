> Spec: Fix tRPC Authentication Middleware - Resolve 401 Unauthorized API Errors
> Created: 2025-07-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

The tRPC API is experiencing 401 Unauthorized errors due to JWT token verification issues. The authentication middleware needs to be fixed to properly handle JWT tokens, validate expiration times, and ensure authorization headers are correctly processed across all API endpoints.

## User Stories

### Authenticated API Access
As a user, I want my authenticated API requests to work reliably so that I can access all features of the application without encountering 401 errors.

**Current Issue**: Users are getting "Invalid or expired token" and "Missing or invalid authorization header" errors when making API calls, even with valid tokens. This breaks features like chat messages, integrations, and workflow execution.

### Token Refresh Flow
As a user, I want my authentication tokens to refresh automatically before expiring so that I don't get logged out unexpectedly during active sessions.

**Current Issue**: Tokens may be expiring without proper refresh handling, causing sudden authentication failures during normal usage.

### Integration OAuth Flow
As a developer using OAuth integrations, I want the authentication to work seamlessly with third-party services so that Gmail, Calendar, and Slack integrations function properly.

**Current Issue**: OAuth flows are failing with 401 errors, preventing users from connecting their accounts and using integrations.

## Spec Scope

1. **JWT Token Verification** - Fix token verification logic to properly validate tokens and handle edge cases
2. **Authorization Header Processing** - Ensure consistent extraction and validation of Bearer tokens from request headers
3. **Token Expiration Handling** - Implement proper token expiration checks and refresh mechanisms
4. **Error Response Improvement** - Provide clear, actionable error messages for different authentication failure scenarios
5. **Test Coverage** - Add comprehensive tests for authentication middleware edge cases

## Out of Scope

- Changing the authentication provider (staying with JWT)
- Modifying the authentication UI/UX
- Implementing new authentication methods (OAuth, SSO, etc.)
- Database schema changes for user management
- Performance optimization unrelated to authentication

## Expected Deliverable

1. All API endpoints properly authenticate valid JWT tokens without 401 errors
2. Clear error messages that distinguish between missing tokens, invalid tokens, and expired tokens
3. Automatic token refresh works seamlessly before expiration
4. Integration OAuth flows complete successfully without authentication errors
5. Comprehensive test suite covering authentication edge cases passes
