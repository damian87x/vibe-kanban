# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-16-agent-template-dynamic-prompts/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. **Implement Dynamic Prompt Generator**
  - [ ] 1.1 Write tests for DynamicPromptGenerator class
  - [ ] 1.2 Create prompt generation service with template parsing
  - [ ] 1.3 Implement integration capability mapping
  - [ ] 1.4 Add prompt caching with TTL support
  - [ ] 1.5 Create variable substitution and optimization logic
  - [ ] 1.6 Verify prompt generation works using MCP browser tools (navigate to test endpoint)
  - [ ] 1.7 Verify all unit tests pass

- [ ] 2. **Create Template-Chat Bridge**
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for chat session initialization from templates
  - [ ] 2.2 Extend ChatService to support template context
  - [ ] 2.3 Implement conversation creation with system prompts
  - [ ] 2.4 Add context preservation during navigation
  - [ ] 2.5 Create auto-execution trigger mechanism
  - [ ] 2.6 Run E2E test to verify template to chat flow works
  - [ ] 2.7 Verify all integration tests pass

- [ ] 3. **Build API Endpoints**
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for all new tRPC routes
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement prompts.generate endpoint with validation
  - [ ] 3.3 Create agents.executeFromTemplate endpoint
  - [ ] 3.4 Add chat.initializeFromTemplate endpoint
  - [ ] 3.5 Implement WebSocket events for execution tracking
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify all endpoints work using MCP browser tools (test each endpoint)
  - [ ] 3.7 Verify API tests pass with proper error handling

- [ ] 4. **Update Frontend Components**
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for UI components
  - [ ] 4.2 Modify agent template preview to include "Run Agent" button
  - [ ] 4.3 Implement prompt customization modal UI
  - [ ] 4.4 Add execution status indicators
  - [ ] 4.5 Create seamless navigation from template to chat
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify UI works using MCP browser tools (navigate, click buttons, take screenshots)
  - [ ] 4.7 Verify all component tests pass

- [ ] 5. **Database and Analytics**
  - [ ] 5.1 Write migration scripts for new tables
  - [ ] 5.2 Run database migrations to create schema
  - [ ] 5.3 Implement execution tracking and metrics collection
  - [ ] 5.4 Create analytics endpoints for performance monitoring
  - [ ] 5.5 Add data retention and cleanup jobs
  - [ ] 5.6 Run integration tests to verify database operations
  - [ ] 5.7 Verify all database tests pass

## Implementation Order

The tasks should be completed in the order listed above as they build upon each other:

1. **Prompt Generator** forms the core engine
2. **Template-Chat Bridge** connects the systems
3. **API Endpoints** expose the functionality
4. **Frontend Updates** provide user interface
5. **Database/Analytics** adds persistence and insights

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can click "Run Agent" from any template and see immediate execution in chat
- [ ] Generated prompts include complete context (goal, integrations, workflow)
- [ ] Chat conversations maintain agent context throughout
- [ ] All tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Performance targets met (< 500ms full flow)
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Notes

- Each major task includes verification using MCP browser tools or E2E tests
- Follow TDD approach - write tests first, then implementation
- Use existing services (AgentDatabaseService, IntegrationManager) where possible
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing agent/chat functionality
- Document any API changes for frontend team
