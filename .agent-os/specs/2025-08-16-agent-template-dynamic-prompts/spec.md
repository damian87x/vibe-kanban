> Spec: Agent Template Dynamic Prompt System
> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a dynamic prompt generation system that uses agent templates to create contextual, goal-oriented prompts for agent execution. This feature will seamlessly integrate templates with chat conversations, enabling agents to execute with proper context, integrations, and workflows while maintaining conversation continuity.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Template-Based Agent Execution

As a user, I want to execute agents from templates that automatically generate appropriate prompts, so that I don't need to manually configure each agent execution.

When I select an agent template and click "Run Agent", the system should:
1. Load the template's default workflow and goal
2. Generate a dynamic prompt based on the template configuration
3. Initialize a chat conversation with the proper system context
4. Include all required integrations and their capabilities
5. Execute the agent with the generated prompt

### Story 2: Seamless Chat Integration

As a user, I want agents to maintain conversation context when transitioning from templates to chat, so that the experience feels continuous and natural.

The workflow involves:
1. Viewing an agent template preview
2. Clicking "Run Agent" to start execution
3. Being redirected to the chat interface
4. Seeing the agent execute with full context
5. Continuing the conversation naturally

### Story 3: Dynamic Prompt Customization

As a power user, I want to customize agent prompts while maintaining template structure, so that I can adapt agents to specific use cases.

This includes:
1. Viewing the generated prompt before execution
2. Modifying parameters or goals
3. Saving customized prompts for reuse
4. Maintaining template benefits while allowing flexibility

## Spec Scope

1. **Dynamic Prompt Generator** - Engine that converts templates to contextual prompts
2. **Template-Chat Bridge** - Seamless integration between template selection and chat execution
3. **Context Preservation** - Maintain workflow, integrations, and goals throughout execution
4. **Prompt Customization UI** - Interface for viewing and modifying generated prompts
5. **Execution Tracking** - Monitor agent performance and prompt effectiveness

## Out of Scope

- Template marketplace or sharing features
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Voice or alternative input methods
- External template formats (only YAML support planned)
- Real-time collaborative editing

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can execute agents from templates with one click, seeing immediate execution in chat
2. Generated prompts include all context from templates (goal, integrations, steps)
3. Chat conversations maintain full agent context and can continue naturally
4. System tracks execution metrics to optimize prompt generation
