## Integration Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Full Feature Development Flow
```gherkin
Given a new feature requirement
When I create a design prompt
And the design is approved after review
And BDD scenarios are generated from the design
And a batch of tickets is created from scenarios
And the batch is executed with multi-agent workflow
Then the feature should be implemented
And all BDD scenarios should pass
And code coverage should exceed 80%
And the implementation should match the design
```

### Scenario 2: Parallel Multi-Agent Execution
```gherkin
Given 5 independent tasks
When I trigger parallel batch processing
And assign different agents to each task
Then all tasks should execute simultaneously
And each should have its own worktree
And no conflicts should occur
And all results should be collected
```

### Scenario 3: Failure Recovery Flow
```gherkin
Given a workflow with retry strategy
When a stage fails due to agent error
Then the system should retry with a different agent
And preserve the execution context
And continue remaining stages
And report the failure and recovery
```

## Validation Execution Plan
