> Spec: Fix Workflow Edit Page TypeScript Errors
> Created: 2025-08-10
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Resolve critical TypeScript errors in the workflow edit page that prevent proper type checking and cause potential runtime failures. This fix will ensure type safety across the tRPC API integration, eliminate unsafe type casting, and standardize error handling patterns.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Story

As a developer working on the workflow edit page, I want TypeScript to provide accurate type checking and IntelliSense, so that I can catch errors at compile time and have confidence in the API integration.

**Detailed Workflow**: Currently, developers encounter TypeScript errors when working on `/app/workflow/[id]/edit.tsx`, preventing proper IDE support and potentially introducing runtime bugs. The tRPC client integration has type mismatches, and unsafe type casting (`as any`) masks underlying schema problems.

### QA Testing Story

As a QA engineer testing workflow functionality, I want all TypeScript errors resolved, so that I can focus on functional testing without being blocked by compilation issues.

**Detailed Workflow**: QA engineers cannot run comprehensive tests due to TypeScript compilation errors. The type issues prevent building test suites and mask potential runtime errors during workflow editing operations.

### Production Stability Story

As a system operator monitoring production, I want workflow edit operations to be type-safe, so that runtime errors are minimized and user experience remains consistent.

**Detailed Workflow**: Type mismatches can cause unexpected runtime failures when users edit workflows, potentially corrupting workflow data or causing crashes during template customization.

## Spec Scope

1. **tRPC Router Consolidation** - Eliminate duplicate workflow routers causing type conflicts between `/workflows/index.ts` and `/workflows/user-workflows.ts`
2. **API Schema Alignment** - Fix parameter structure mismatches between backend routes and frontend tRPC calls
3. **Type Safety Enhancement** - Replace unsafe type casting with proper TypeScript interfaces and type guards
4. **Error Handling Standardization** - Implement consistent error handling patterns across workflow edit operations
5. **Interface Definition Completion** - Create missing type definitions for workflow templates and unified interfaces

## Out of Scope

- Functional changes to workflow editing behavior
- UI/UX improvements to the workflow editor
- Performance optimizations unrelated to type safety
- Migration of existing workflow data formats
- Adding new workflow editing features

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Zero TypeScript Compilation Errors** - The workflow edit page compiles without any TypeScript errors or warnings
2. **Full tRPC Type Safety** - All tRPC calls have proper type inference and autocompletion in IDEs  
3. **Runtime Error Prevention** - Type guards and proper interfaces prevent runtime type errors during workflow operations
