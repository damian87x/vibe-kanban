# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Voice Recording Audio Format Fix
> Created: 2025-07-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the voice recording functionality in the AI Assistant interface by updating the audio format configuration to accept 'webm' format or convert it to a supported format. This will restore the voice transcription feature and improve user experience by enabling hands-free interaction with the AI assistant.

## User Stories

### Voice Input for AI Assistant

As a business professional, I want to use voice input to interact with the AI assistant, so that I can communicate naturally without typing and maintain productivity while multitasking.

The user clicks the microphone button in the assistant interface, speaks their request, and the system transcribes their voice to text. Currently, this workflow is broken due to a format mismatch - the browser records in 'webm' format but the backend expects 'wav', 'mp3', 'ogg', or 'm4a'. This prevents users from using the voice-first design principle that is core to the product mission.

## Spec Scope

1. **Audio Format Support** - Update backend to accept 'webm' format or implement client-side conversion
2. **Error Handling** - Add graceful error handling for unsupported audio formats
3. **Format Validation** - Implement proper validation to prevent format mismatches
4. **User Feedback** - Provide clear error messages when voice recording fails

## Out of Scope

- Implementing new voice features beyond fixing the current format issue
- Changing the voice transcription provider (Whisper)
- Adding support for multiple simultaneous audio recordings
- Modifying the UI/UX of the voice recording interface

## Expected Deliverable

1. Voice recording button successfully captures audio and transcribes it to text
2. Support for webm format either through backend acceptance or client-side conversion
3. Clear error messages displayed to users if recording fails
