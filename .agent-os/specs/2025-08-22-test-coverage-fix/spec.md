# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Backend Test Coverage and Import Path Fixes
> Created: 2025-08-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the critically low test coverage (2.92%) and resolve import path issues causing 26 test suites to fail. This spec addresses the testing infrastructure problems identified after the backend refactoring to ensure code quality and maintainability.

## User Stories

### Developer Testing Confidence

As a developer, I want all tests to pass with good coverage, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

Currently, 26 test suites are failing due to incorrect import paths using `@backend/` aliases that no longer resolve. Additionally, test coverage is critically low at 2.92%, making it impossible to verify that the refactored code works correctly. After fixing these issues, developers will have a robust test suite that validates the codebase.

### CI/CD Pipeline Reliability

As a DevOps engineer, I want the test suite to run successfully in CI/CD pipelines, so that deployments are safe and automated.

The failing tests block automated deployments and require manual intervention. With fixed tests and improved coverage, the CI/CD pipeline can automatically validate changes and deploy with confidence.

## Spec Scope

1. **Import Path Resolution** - Fix all `@backend/` import paths in test files to use correct relative paths
2. **Test Configuration Update** - Update Jest and TypeScript configurations to properly resolve module paths
3. **tRPC Router Testing** - Add comprehensive tests for the new lazy-loaded tRPC router implementation
4. **Coverage Improvement** - Increase test coverage from 2.92% to at least 60% for critical paths
5. **Test Infrastructure** - Ensure all test utilities and mocks work with the refactored architecture

## Out of Scope

- Adding new features or functionality
- Refactoring production code (only test code)
- E2E browser automation tests
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation updates (except test-related)

## Expected Deliverable

1. All 26 failing test suites pass successfully
2. Test coverage increases to at least 60% for statements
3. tRPC endpoints can be tested properly with the new lazy loading
4. CI/CD pipeline runs tests without errors
