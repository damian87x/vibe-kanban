# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-22-backend-refactoring/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-22
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**app.ts**
- Test that all endpoints return expected responses
- Verify CORS is properly configured
- Test lazy loading mechanism triggers on first request
- Verify cached handler is reused on subsequent requests
- Test error handling when tRPC import fails

**server.ts**
- Verify server starts on correct port
- Test database initialization sequence
- Verify provider factory initialization
- Test graceful shutdown handling

**Provider Factory Updates**
- Test that all services use ProviderFactory.getInstance()
- Verify circuit breaker functionality remains intact
- Test mock/real provider switching

### Integration Tests

**Server Startup**
- Full server startup with all dependencies
- Verify all health check endpoints respond
- Test tRPC routes are accessible
- Verify lazy loading doesn't break existing functionality

**API Compatibility**
- Test all existing endpoints maintain same response format
- Verify authentication flows work identically
- Test database queries execute properly
- Verify WebSocket connections if applicable

### Regression Tests

**Import Path Fixes**
- All 26 currently failing test suites must pass
- No new test failures introduced
- Maintain or improve code coverage

### Performance Tests

**Startup Performance**
- Measure and verify 20% startup time improvement
- Monitor initial memory usage reduction
- Test lazy loading timing

**Runtime Performance**
- Verify API response times remain under 200ms
- Test concurrent request handling
- Monitor memory usage under load

## Mocking Requirements

- **Database**: Use test database for integration tests
- **External Services**: Mock provider factory for unit tests
- **tRPC Context**: Mock authentication context for isolated tests
- **File System**: Mock for date determination tests

## Test Execution Plan

1. Fix import paths in failing tests first
2. Run existing test suite to establish baseline
3. Add new unit tests for refactored code
4. Run integration tests to verify functionality
5. Perform manual E2E testing of critical flows
6. Execute performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria

- All 26 previously failing tests pass
- No regression in existing test coverage
- New code has >80% test coverage
- Performance improvements validated through benchmarks
- All API endpoints verified working through E2E tests
