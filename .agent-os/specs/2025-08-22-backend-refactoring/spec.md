> Spec: Backend Server Architecture Refactoring
> Created: 2025-08-22
> Status: In Progress

## Overview

Refactor the backend server architecture to consolidate multiple Hono server files into a single, maintainable structure with lazy-loaded tRPC handlers. This refactoring reduces code complexity by removing 600+ lines of legacy code while maintaining all existing functionality and improving startup performance.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Improvement

As a developer, I want to work with a simplified backend architecture, so that I can understand and maintain the codebase more easily.

The current backend has multiple server files (hono.ts, start.js, app-router-compiled.js) that create confusion about entry points and initialization flow. After refactoring, developers will have a single, clear app.ts file that handles all routing with lazy-loaded dependencies for optimal performance.

### Application Performance

As a system administrator, I want the backend to start quickly and use resources efficiently, so that deployment and scaling are more cost-effective.

The lazy-loading approach ensures that heavy dependencies (like tRPC router compilation) only load when actually needed, reducing initial memory footprint and startup time.

## Spec Scope

1. **Server Consolidation** - Merge hono.ts, start.js, and app-router-compiled.js into a single app.ts file
2. **Lazy Loading Implementation** - Implement lazy loading for tRPC handler with proper caching
3. **Service Updates** - Update all service imports to use the new provider factory pattern
4. **Test Utilities** - Create test-server.ts and test-trpc.ts for isolated testing
5. **Path Resolution Fixes** - Fix import paths in tests to resolve 26 failing test suites

## Out of Scope

- Database schema changes
- API endpoint modifications
- Frontend changes
- Authentication flow changes
- New feature additions

## Expected Deliverable

1. All backend services start successfully with the new architecture
2. All existing API endpoints work identically to before
3. All 26 failing test suites pass with corrected import paths
4. Lazy loading reduces initial memory usage measurably
