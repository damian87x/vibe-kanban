> Spec: HTTPS/SSL Configuration with Let's Encrypt
> Created: 2025-01-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement automatic HTTPS/SSL certificate provisioning and renewal using Let's Encrypt for the TaskPilot AI Workspace production environment. This will ensure all production traffic is encrypted and secure, meeting modern web security standards.

## User Stories

### Secure Production Access

As a TaskPilot user, I want all my interactions with the application to be encrypted over HTTPS, so that my sensitive data (including OAuth tokens, AI conversations, and personal information) is protected from interception.

Currently, the production deployment may not have proper SSL configuration, potentially exposing user data to man-in-the-middle attacks and causing browser security warnings that reduce user trust.

### Automatic Certificate Management

As a DevOps engineer, I want SSL certificates to be automatically provisioned and renewed without manual intervention, so that the application maintains continuous secure access without certificate expiration downtime.

The system should handle initial certificate provisioning, automatic renewal before expiration, and graceful handling of renewal failures with proper alerting.

### Multi-Domain Support

As a system administrator, I want to secure multiple domains and subdomains under a single certificate management system, so that we can support staging environments and API endpoints with proper SSL coverage.

This includes securing the main application domain, API subdomain, and any future staging or development domains that need SSL in cloud environments.

## Spec Scope

1. **Let's Encrypt Integration** - Implement ACME protocol client for automated certificate management
2. **Nginx SSL Configuration** - Configure Nginx reverse proxy with modern SSL/TLS settings
3. **Certificate Auto-Renewal** - Set up automated renewal process with cron jobs or systemd timers
4. **HTTP to HTTPS Redirect** - Force all HTTP traffic to redirect to HTTPS
5. **Security Headers** - Implement HSTS, CSP, and other security headers for A+ SSL rating

## Out of Scope

- Custom SSL certificates from other providers
- Client certificate authentication
- SSL pinning for mobile applications
- Wildcard certificates (unless needed for subdomains)
- Load balancer SSL termination (handled by Cloud Run)

## Expected Deliverable

1. All production traffic automatically redirected from HTTP to HTTPS
2. Valid SSL certificate automatically provisioned and visible in browser
3. SSL Labs A+ rating achieved with proper security headers
