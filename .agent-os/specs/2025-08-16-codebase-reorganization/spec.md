# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Codebase Reorganization to Clean Monorepo Structure
> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Reorganize the existing codebase into a clean monorepo structure with minimal effort, moving code into organized `src/` directories while maintaining functionality and fixing broken package.json scripts. This reorganization will improve maintainability, developer experience, and project structure clarity.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Improvement

As a developer, I want to have a clear separation between frontend, backend, and infrastructure code, so that I can easily navigate the codebase and understand where different components live. I want package.json scripts to work correctly in their respective directories and have a clean project structure that follows modern monorepo best practices.

### Maintenance and Organization

As a project maintainer, I want the codebase organized into logical directories with proper separation of concerns, so that new team members can quickly understand the project structure and existing functionality can be maintained more efficiently. I want documentation centralized and tests organized by type.

## Spec Scope

1. **Frontend Reorganization** - Move React Native/Expo app code into `src/frontend/` with working package.json scripts
2. **Backend Reorganization** - Move backend services into `src/backend/` with proper package.json and build scripts
3. **DevOps Infrastructure** - Organize deployment, Docker, and infrastructure files into `src/devops/`
4. **Scripts Organization** - Move utility and test scripts to root level `scripts/` with proper categorization
5. **Documentation Centralization** - Consolidate all documentation into `docs/` at root level
6. **Test Organization** - Reorganize tests into `tests/` with clear separation of unit, integration, and e2e tests
7. **Package.json Scripts Fix** - Ensure all scripts work correctly in their respective directories
8. **Monorepo Structure** - Implement clean monorepo layout with minimal breaking changes

## Out of Scope

- Major refactoring of existing code functionality
- Changes to business logic or API contracts
- Database schema modifications
- Performance optimizations
- New feature development

## Expected Deliverable

1. Clean monorepo structure with `src/` containing organized frontend, backend, and devops directories
2. Working package.json scripts in each directory with proper dependencies
3. Centralized documentation and organized test structure
4. Minimal disruption to existing development workflow
5. Clear separation of concerns between different parts of the system
