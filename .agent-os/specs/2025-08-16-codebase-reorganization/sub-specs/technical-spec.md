# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-16-codebase-reorganization/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-16
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Maintain all existing functionality while reorganizing file structure
- Ensure package.json scripts work correctly in their respective directories
- Preserve all import paths and module resolution
- Keep existing build and deployment processes functional
- Maintain TypeScript configuration and compilation
- Preserve test configurations and test runner setups

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Gradual Migration with Symlinks (Selected)
- Pros: Minimal disruption, easy rollback, preserves existing workflows
- Cons: Temporary complexity during transition
- **Rationale:** Provides safest migration path with minimal risk

**Option B:** Complete Restructure in One Go
- Pros: Clean final state immediately
- Cons: High risk of breaking existing functionality, difficult rollback
- **Rationale:** Too risky for production codebase

**Option C:** Hybrid Approach with Staged Migration
- Pros: Balanced risk and cleanliness
- Cons: More complex planning required
- **Rationale:** Good balance but more complex than Option A

## External Dependencies

- **No new libraries required** - This is purely a structural reorganization
- **Justification:** All existing dependencies and tools remain the same
- **Version requirements:** Maintain existing versions to avoid compatibility issues

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Create New Structure
1. Create `src/` directory with subdirectories
2. Move files to new locations
3. Update import paths incrementally

### Phase 2: Update Package.json Files
1. Split root package.json into domain-specific ones
2. Update script paths and dependencies
3. Test all scripts work correctly

### Phase 3: Cleanup and Verification
1. Remove old directories
2. Update documentation references
3. Verify all functionality works

## Risk Mitigation

- **Backup Strategy:** Create git branch before starting
- **Rollback Plan:** Keep original structure until fully verified
- **Testing Approach:** Test each phase before proceeding
- **Documentation:** Document all changes for team reference
