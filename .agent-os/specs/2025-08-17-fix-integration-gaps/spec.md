> Spec: Fix Integration Gaps and Simplify Architecture
> Created: 2025-08-17
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix critical gaps between chat, integrations, and templates while simplifying the overly complex architecture. This addresses broken features, missing connections, and unnecessary abstractions that prevent the system from working as designed.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Working Chat-Integration Connection

As a user, I want the chat assistant to dynamically use my connected integrations and execute workflows seamlessly, so that I can accomplish tasks without manual intervention.

The workflow involves:
1. Connecting integrations (Gmail, Calendar, Slack)
2. Chat assistant automatically discovering available tools
3. Templates dynamically adapting to connected integrations
4. Workflows executing directly from chat messages
5. Real-time status updates as integrations are used
6. Clear visibility of what actions were taken

### Story 2: Functional Knowledge Base with Vector Search

As a user, I want to upload documents to the knowledge base and have them searchable with semantic similarity, so that the AI can reference my documents intelligently.

The experience includes:
1. Upload documents through the knowledge interface
2. Documents are processed and embedded for vector search
3. Chat can semantically search uploaded documents
4. Relevant document snippets appear in responses
5. No orphaned files in S3 or database
6. Clear upload status and error handling

### Story 3: Simplified Developer Experience

As a developer, I want a clean, maintainable codebase without redundant abstractions, so that I can quickly understand and modify the system.

This enables:
1. Single database service instead of three
2. Unified migration system
3. Clean provider factory without deprecated methods
4. Simple OAuth configuration
5. No duplicate file structures
6. Clear, working health checks

## Spec Scope

1. **Dynamic Template-Chat Bridge** - Implement real template-to-prompt generation with context awareness
2. **Agent Session Management** - Add persistent agent sessions across conversations with state tracking
3. **Integration Event System** - Create real-time integration status updates and tool discovery
4. **Knowledge Base Vector Search** - Enable pgvector and implement semantic document search
5. **Architecture Simplification** - Consolidate database services, remove deprecated code, clean up duplicates

## Out of Scope

- Multi-agent collaboration features
- Voice input/output capabilities
- Cross-user sharing of agents or sessions
- Custom template builder UI
- Advanced workflow visual editor

## Expected Deliverable

1. Chat dynamically discovers and uses connected integrations with real-time status updates
2. Templates generate context-aware prompts and execute workflows directly from chat
3. Knowledge base supports vector search with working document upload and retrieval
4. Codebase simplified by ~30% with consolidated services and removed duplicates
