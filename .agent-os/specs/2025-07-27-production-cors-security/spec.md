# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Production CORS Security Configuration
> Created: 2025-07-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the critical CORS security vulnerability by replacing the wildcard (*) CORS policy with environment-specific domain restrictions to prevent cross-origin attacks in production. This implementation will maintain development flexibility while enforcing strict security controls in production environments.

## User Stories

### Secure Production Environment

As a security administrator, I want CORS requests to be restricted to only authorized domains in production, so that unauthorized websites cannot make requests to our API and access sensitive user data.

**Workflow**: Production deployment automatically enforces domain-specific CORS policies based on environment variables, blocking any requests from unauthorized origins while maintaining legitimate frontend access.

### Development Flexibility

As a developer, I want CORS to remain permissive in development environments, so that I can test the application from localhost, ngrok tunnels, and other development domains without configuration barriers.

**Workflow**: Development and staging environments maintain flexible CORS policies that support localhost, development domains, and testing tools while clearly distinguishing from production security requirements.

### Environment-Based Configuration

As a DevOps engineer, I want CORS policies to be configured through environment variables, so that I can manage domain restrictions across different environments without code changes.

**Workflow**: Environment variables define allowed origins for each deployment environment, enabling secure configuration management and easy updates without application redeployment.

## Spec Scope

1. **CORS Configuration System** - Replace wildcard CORS with environment-based domain configuration
2. **Production Security Enforcement** - Implement strict domain validation for production environments  
3. **Development Environment Support** - Maintain permissive CORS for development and testing
4. **Environment Variable Management** - Add CORS domain configuration to environment variable system
5. **Security Testing** - Validate CORS restrictions prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests

## Out of Scope

- CSRF token implementation (separate security concern)
- Rate limiting (covered in different roadmap item)
- API authentication changes (already implemented)
- CDN CORS configuration (future enhancement)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Production deployment blocks unauthorized cross-origin requests while allowing legitimate frontend access
2. Development environment maintains flexible CORS for testing with localhost and development domains
3. Environment variable system controls CORS domain restrictions across all deployment environments
