# Tasks for Fix Integration QA Issues

## Phase 1: Local Environment Investigation (P0 - 2 hours)

### Setup and Initial Testing
- [ ] Start backend and frontend locally
- [ ] Navigate to integrations page
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Test clicking each integration type (Gmail, Calendar, Slack)
- [ ] Verify network requests are being made

### Debug OAuth Flow
- [ ] Check OAuth provider configuration (Klavis/Composio)
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Test OAuth initiation endpoint directly
- [ ] Check OAuth callback URLs are correct for local development
- [ ] Verify frontend is handling OAuth redirects

## Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis (P0 - 1 hour)

### Frontend Investigation
- [ ] Check integration component click handlers
- [ ] Verify API calls are being made on button clicks
- [ ] Check for loading states and error handling
- [ ] Verify routing after OAuth callback

### Backend Investigation  
- [ ] Test integration endpoints with curl/Postman
- [ ] Check OAuth provider initialization
- [ ] Verify database integration storage
- [ ] Check error logs for OAuth failures

## Phase 3: Fix Implementation (P0 - 2 hours)

### Frontend Fixes
- [ ] Add proper loading states for integration actions
- [ ] Implement error message display
- [ ] Fix click handlers if broken
- [ ] Add console logging for debugging

### Backend Fixes
- [ ] Fix OAuth initiation if broken
- [ ] Ensure proper error responses
- [ ] Fix callback handling
- [ ] Add detailed logging for OAuth flow

## Phase 4: Production Testing (P1 - 1 hour)

### Google Cloud Deployment
- [ ] Deploy fixes to Google Cloud
- [ ] Test integration flow on production URL
- [ ] Verify OAuth callbacks work with production URLs
- [ ] Check production logs for errors
- [ ] Test with real Google account

## Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing (P1 - 2 hours)

### Integration Flow Testing
- [ ] Test complete OAuth flow for each provider
- [ ] Verify integrations show as connected
- [ ] Test using integrations in workflows
- [ ] Test integration disconnection
- [ ] Test error scenarios

### E2E Test Creation
- [ ] Write E2E tests for integration connection
- [ ] Write tests for integration usage in workflows
- [ ] Add tests to CI/CD pipeline

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All three integrations (Gmail, Calendar, Slack) can be connected successfully
- [ ] OAuth flow completes without errors
- [ ] Connected integrations are usable in workflows
- [ ] Clear feedback provided to users during connection process
- [ ] Works on both local and production environments

## Notes

- Priority: P0 (Critical - Feature completely broken)
- Estimated Time: 8 hours total
- Resources Needed: Access to Google Cloud logs, OAuth provider accounts
