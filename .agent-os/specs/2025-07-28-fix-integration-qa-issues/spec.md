# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Fix Integration QA Issues
> Created: 2025-07-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Users are reporting that integration features appear to do nothing when accessed. The integrations page may load but interactions don't result in any visible actions or feedback. This needs to be investigated both locally and on Google Cloud deployment to identify and fix the root cause preventing integrations from functioning properly.

## User Stories

### Integration Connection Flow
As a user, I want to connect my Gmail, Calendar, or Slack integrations so that I can use them in my workflows and agents, but currently clicking on integration options results in no visible action or feedback.

**Current Issue**: User navigates to integrations, clicks to connect a service, but nothing happens - no OAuth flow, no error message, no loading state.

### Integration Usage in Workflows
As a workflow creator, I want to use my connected integrations in workflow steps, but the integration tools don't appear or don't function when selected.

**Current Issue**: Even if integrations appear connected, they don't work when used in actual workflows or agent tools.

## Spec Scope

1. **Local Environment Testing** - Start application locally and test integration flows end-to-end
2. **Production Testing** - Test on Google Cloud deployment to verify production-specific issues
3. **OAuth Flow Debugging** - Verify OAuth redirects and callbacks are working correctly
4. **Error Handling** - Implement proper error messages and loading states for user feedback
5. **Integration Provider Verification** - Check both Klavis and Composio providers are functioning

## Out of Scope

- Adding new integration providers
- Changing OAuth provider architecture
- Modifying integration permissions or scopes
- Performance optimization (unless causing the issue)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Integrations page shows clear connection status for each service
2. OAuth flow initiates properly when clicking "Connect" for any integration
3. Connected integrations are usable in workflows and agents
4. Clear error messages displayed if integration fails
5. Both local and production environments have working integrations

## Technical Investigation Areas

- Frontend integration UI components and click handlers
- Backend OAuth initiation endpoints
- OAuth callback handling
- Integration status checking
- Provider factory configuration
- Environment variable setup for OAuth providers
